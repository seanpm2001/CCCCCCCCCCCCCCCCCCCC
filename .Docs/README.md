# Actual documentation for CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC

Contrary to what you may be thinking, this isn't an entirely dysfunctional project.

This project makes heavy use of displaying the letter C, with an attempt to have everything display this letter.

For functionality, structural, and documentation purposes, some exceptions were made. For example, hidden directories (directories that start with `.`) are exempt from the project theme, and can contain useful information, like what you are reading right now.

To get the full experience, download the repository, and turn hidden folders off.

Additionally, source code comments in Markdown can contain actual information as well.

The theme of this project is designed to be a joke project, but it also plans to be a very tiny, basic operating system written entirely in C.
